# Responsive Landing Page

This project is a simple and clean landing page built using just HTML and CSS. It was created as part of a web development internship task to practice front-end basics like layout, styling, and responsive design.

The page includes a header with navigation, a hero section with a heading and button, and a footer with social links. I used Flexbox for layout and added media queries to make sure the design looks good on both desktop and mobile screens.

Everything was coded from scratch without using any frameworks or libraries. It was built using VS Code and tested with Live Server.
